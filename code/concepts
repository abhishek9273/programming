Reentrancy and Interrupt Handlers
Interrupt handlers in Linux need not be reentrant. When a given interrupt handler is executing, the corresponding interrupt line is masked out on all processors, preventing another
interrupt on the same line from being received. Normally all other interrupts are enabled, so
other interrupts are serviced, but the current line is always disabled. Consequently, the
same interrupt handler is never invoked concurrently to service a nested interrupt. This
greatly simplifies writing your interrupt handler.
